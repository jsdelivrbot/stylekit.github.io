//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 tween white<->green
//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 circle with current.width -> circle.height

//animate pos of switch to target end pos based on +-0.5 (left or right) easein 0.2

//mouse-up: within 50% and the state is the same -> tween to on state (and the same for the opposite condition)
