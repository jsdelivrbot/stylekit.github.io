My notes on Carthage<!--more--> 

## First Impression:

## Concept:

Carthage doesn’t really do anything magic; you’re always in control. You manually add dependencies to your Xcode project and Carthage fetches and builds them.


## Uninstalling Carthage

```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/CarthageKit.framework
rm -f /usr/local/bin/carthage
```


## Installing Carthage:

Inatalling carthage 0.18.1 was a bit tricky. It worked flawlessly on my mac mini server but not so much on my macbook pro. 
After installing Carthage from the .pkg file. Terminal would not find carthage. So in order to make it work i had to hunt down the path where Carthage resided: ```` and then figure out how to make an Alias in terminal. 

1. In terminal type: ``nano .bash_profile``  
2. Then add this ``alias carthage="sudo /usr/local/bin/carthage"``  
3. ``ctrl + o``` and then ``enter`` and then ``ctrl x``  
4. That drawback is that you have to type your password every time you want to use carthage.
