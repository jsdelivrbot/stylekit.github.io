### Shape:
```
//40px height, 70px width
//grey outline 2px
//dropShadow downwards
//bg fill white
```


### Transition to: (0-1)
```
//green outline 2px
//bg fill green
//dropShadow downwards
```


### Animation:

```
//on circle down : animate circle width 20% easeIn 0.2 sec (left if its in right pos, right if in left pos)
//when dragging: keep circle width at 120%

//for simplicity: transition from white to green based on volKnobProgress

//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 tween white<->green
//on switch up: easeIn 0.2 circle with current.width -> circle.height

//animate pos of switch to target end pos based on +-0.5 (left or right) easeIn 0.2

//mouse-up: within 50% and the state is the same -> tween to on state (and the same for the opposite condition)
	//possibly disable functionality while transitioning. 
```


### Inspiration:
Original IOS switch: https://github.com/cruffenach/CRToast

real ios switch example: https://github.com/cruffenach/CRToast

### Original IOS switch behaviour analysis:

- The white fill in the Switch-background animates from the center until it covers the grey/green  
- The white fill tweens inwards when animating from green/grey to white  
- the grey green fill tweens very fast going from off<->on state  
- The grey/green outline needs to be outside or else the white will cover it  

- The thumb animates onUp and onDown 
- the thumb slightly bounces back if it is clicked as opposed to being dragged


### Todo:

- [ ] Try to animate the thumb onUp onDown ðŸ‘ˆ
- [ ] Try to setup bg fills that can animate in the future
- [ ] Try to animate the bg fills
- [ ] onUpInside warrants state change off<->on
- [ ] animate off<->on progress
- [ ] animate w/ bounce
- [ ] onSlide -> +- 0.5 animates on/off state (slide does not directly change thumb.pos)
