## POP VS OOP
If you find your self having similar code in many places, your probably doing it wrong. consider using POP. Because with POP you can reuse the same code. 

## Drawbacks with pop:
ITs harder to understand the structure, what overrides. Ive developed a way of thinking about called "shallow deep" Basically. Shallow calls are calls that comes from class. And deep calls are calls that comes from a template method in a protocol. You can override calls coming from template methods, But at that point you can only call the same method across. calls form shallow on the other hand can also override and call a sort of "super" on the same method. The drawback is that you have to be peculiar when you design your method chains when compositing with protocols. As oppose to OOP where you can easily just call up and down the hierarchy with super and override. Ill explain with a diagram:
