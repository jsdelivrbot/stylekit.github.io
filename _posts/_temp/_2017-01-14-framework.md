Some notes on .framework <!--more--> 

## NOTES:

- Apple claims that its best to use less than 6 .frameworks in your app. Or else compile time may suffer

## Resources:

- Make a framework of your swift files in a xcode project. And also add playground that can import the framework: [here](https://medium.com/@LogMaestro/adding-playgrounds-to-your-xcode-project-79d5ea0c7087#.q27u3w639)
