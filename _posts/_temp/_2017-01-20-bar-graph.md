### Discussion:
Ideally it would be best to have a center of gravity at 0 and then have additons shoot upwards and deletions shoot downwards. However it requires one to handle cases where there is no deletions for instance. And also should the up/down max value be uniform or? A simpler approach is to just account for additions. Simple design that is very similar to how the Graph is setup. 


### 5 vertical indicators (amount of addition deletions)


12,6,0,6,12
100,50,0,50,100

### 7 Horizontal indicators (days per week)

m,t,w,t,f,s,s

Horisontal Gradient colors or?
