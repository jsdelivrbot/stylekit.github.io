On Entering flow<!--more--> 

I don't try to work hard or work as much as I can , I rather try to Enter Flow as many times as possible throughout the day. Mini breaks helps to retain the flow highs. 
I do not believe in systems to keep you in check, all systems are prisons. I rather believe that I need to be open to all input, wims i get through the day. Keep your door open to the world or you will work on sightly the wrong thing. <-link
I have two rules: Wear Noice cancelling headphones. And Don't waste your flow time on things that don't require flow. 
My day is like this: 


Create a nice diagram with emojis that symbolize football, pizza, fruits etc...maybe. My flow chart..pun intended 🤣

Flows last usually around 1 H or less. The same reason why school hours are counted as 45Min. They 👀 knew about flow back-when as well. In truth I dont work more than 8H. I just spread it out over 17Hours so that I peak more often, rather than try and peak 8 times inside 8 hours which is impossible. You only get max 3-4 peaks inside 8 hours. Regular office hours.
