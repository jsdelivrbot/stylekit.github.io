<!--more--> "Kulturhuset" is a new place in the startup scene in Oslo. Its free and can be used by anyone to collaborate or work on different projects. Wifi, seating and water is free. There is also a paid tier. Such as Coffee, beer, pingpong. Its smack in the center of Oslo and a short stroll from Grunerl√∏kka or St.haugen. Its perfect for meetings with clients or hanging out on weekends. You can work there until 3AM but its pretty packed on Weekends. This is the place to go to if you want to meet other like-minded designers/writers/developers/creatives etc.
