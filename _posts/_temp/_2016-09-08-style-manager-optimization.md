Figure out how to store css in style-manager with hash

Every element runs over every style added to the styleManager

So by hashing each style 

Also create a cache system where you store the last 20 queries: 

You would need to store each style selector in a separate hash id.

And then instead of looping over style.selectors you loop over elementQuerrySelectors and for each selector found you querry the hash id. This could potentially increase look-up-time because so many more lookups would happen. Maybe the cache is good enough

You could create a hash table based on the num of selectors in a style. Because if a style has more selctors than the element -> then its not within scope and will not be used. This way you can decrease lookup-time. 

And also the last element.selector must match the last element.selectors so we could create a hash table. The exception is the values that can inherit. (we could make a different system for these values)

A seperate array for styles that have inheritable values. and filtering values upon match.



**element selectors: **

```
Window Button#custom Text#buttonText
```

**Style Selector:**

```
Button Text (applies)
Window TextArea (does not apply)
Window (partly applies, font etc)
```


 
```swift
//cache idea (sudo code):
cache.recentlyUsed = []

//cache.style()

//you ask StyleResolver.style for the style. which has
//cache then queries the 10 last used styles it has in cache.styles
	//if cache.styles doesn't have the absolute style. 
		//style = StyleResolver.resolveStyle()
		//let idx = -1
		//for i < .count{
			//if($0.address == absolute-style-address){
				//idx = i
				//break
		//if(idx != -1)//already exists in cache
			ArrayModifier.indexSwap(.recentlyUsed,idx)//move to front
		//else//does not exist in cache
			//if(recentlyUsed.count > 9){
				//recently.popLast()
			//recently.unshift((style,address))//add to front
				

//let absolute-element-selector-address = ElementParser.stackString(button) 
//let address = SelectorParser.string($0.selectors)

```
The cache system should also move the most popular queries to the top of the array list
so basically the the cache styles should be like this -> cache.styles:[(IStyle,Int)] (<--using duplets where int is the popularity count) (popularity is good for repeating calls to styleResolver. like on hover etc)

```swift
StyleManger.getStyles(elementSelectors.count)

var maxSelectorCount:Int?
var minSelectorCount:Int?
var hashedStyles:Dictionary<selectorCount,[IStyle]>
//[]?
/*
 * NOTE: the hashedStyles are sorted on selectorCount from 1 and upwards
 */
func getStyles(selectorCount:Int)-> [IStyle]{
    var styles:[IStyle]
    for i = selectorCount; count < maxSelectorCount; i++;{
        if let value = hashedStyles[i.string]{
            styles += value
        }
    }
    return styles
}
```

```swift
//Grouping code:
/**
 * Creates a directory with lists of styles. if style.selector.count is 3, then its added to the key:3 and also every key that is bigger than 3
 * PARAM: f: the key to group by (its a method that gets each item in items)
 * PARAM: items: the items to be grouped
 * PARAM: o: is an item in items
 * 
 */
func groupby<T, H: Hashable>(items: [T], f: (T) -> H) -> [H: [T]] {
    return items.reduce([:], combine: { (var ac: [H: [T]], o: T) -> [H: [T]] in
        let selectorCount:Int = f(o)/*h is the key, an item is passed to f to get h*/
        if var c = ac[selectorCount] {/*if something already exist at key: h then append to that value*/
            c.append(o)
            ac.updateValue(c, forKey: selectorCount)/*re-add that value*/
        }
        ac.keys.forEach{
             if(h > $0) {
                ac.updateValue([o], forKey: selectorCount)/*add the item from items as an array*/
            }
        }
        return ac/*Return the grouped list*/
    })
}
let result = groupby([Style(),Style(),Style()], f: { $0.selectors.count })
```

- [x] build the recently queries cache system (its easy) 
- [ ] build the selector-count hashtable system (its easy too)
- [ ] build the cache system that is based on popularity
- [x] Test if speed goes up after implementing these two optimization efforts (use a timer before and after)
- [ ] More struct classes will speed things up probably. Style could be struct maybe? 
- [ ] Use Enum instead of constants?
- [ ] consider to build selector.last hashtable that would speed things up even further
- [ ] Figure out why copying values is faster than changing them. 

 //test how many element selector addresses are similar
        
        //then do the last selector optimization that doesnt work with inheritage. 
        
        //find which variable inherite, can these be added to its own array, so that one array is at least optimized.
        
        
```swift
//new idea:
//a selector has: element,id,state,class

//getStyles[element,id,state,class]->[IStyle]

//Window#customWin TextButton Text#title//<--4 selectors
//

//getStyles(selector)//<--basically the last Selector entity so Button#custom for instance is an selector entity

func getStyles(selector:Selector)->IStyle{
    var styles:[IStyle] = []
    styles += stylesByElement[selector.element]
    styles += stylesByID[selector.id]
    styles += stylesByClassId[selector.classId]
    styles += stylesByState[selector.state]
}
func hashStyle(style:IStyle){
    //when you add styles:
    if(style.selectors.lastItem.element != ""){
        if let styles = stylesByElement[style.selectors.lastItem.element]{
            styles.append(style)
        }else{
            stylesByElement[style.selectors.lastItem.element] = [style]
        }
    }
    if(style.selectors.lastItem.id != ""){
        
    }
    if(style.selectors.lastItem.classIds.count > 0){
        
    }
    if(style.selectors.lastItem.states.count > 0){
        
    }    
}

//Window
    //TextButton
        //Text
//TextButton
//Text
//#customWin

```

//shaving off 1 sec of 6 secs, isnt going to cut it. research how other css engines work so well.
//make style into struct
//research why struct is faster or slower
