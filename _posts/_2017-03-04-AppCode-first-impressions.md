- AppCode edits your xcode .xcodeproject file when moving files. Everything is perfectly mirrored. This is worth its weight in gold alone. My projects are going to be so organized.

- AppCode can rename symbolically. Meaning it can rename a function and globally change every reference in your entire codebase to the new name.
